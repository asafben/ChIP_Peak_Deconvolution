# ChIP_Peak_Deconvolution
Suppose someone performed a ChIP-Seq experiment to find the binding sites of a transcription factor.  
Subsequently they used a discriminative model to identify the genomic regions in which there was a significant binding of the TF.  
We will try to find the exact binding locations of the TF and quantify the strength of the signal at each site.  
The data provided ("synth bind.tab") contains four hypothetical 50bp genomic regions, identified by the discriminative model. The values in the table represent the normalized number of reads in each genomic location.
